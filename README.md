# BellyButtonBiodiversity Challenge

* Building an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
* The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
* Different test subjects can be selected from a dropdown list to show the following:
    * Demographic information of the test subject
    * Bar chart of top ten OTUs
    * Bubble chart of all OTUs values
    * Gauge indicating washing frequency
